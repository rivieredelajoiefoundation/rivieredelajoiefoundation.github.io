      <h2>FIGHTING TEENAGE PREGNANCIES AND REHABILITATION OF TEEN MOTHERS</h2>
      <p class="content">In this project we carry out numerous activities responding to 3 dimensions of interventions: 
    
          1. Preventing Phase
          for the Preventing phase, we do activities aiming at inhibiting causes of
            teenage pregnancies through sensitizations of the mass, traing of the youths, children structures and 
            parents sensitizing to own the battle against this scourge. We at Riviere de la joie Foundation 
            call it, "Dangerous animal we ought to attack together as one."
            we use the media both classic and social media platforms to amplify the voice and make it heard by the masses
          
           2. Responding Phase
          we do train the victims and do the Mentorship program to mentor them,
            and help revive their hopes that due to pregnancy, one gets discouraged and have her
            hope for bright future fade, it's against that backdrop, we do Mentorship to restore 
            their hope and help them catchup with their visions and dreams.
          
          3. Reporting Phase
          We do the alert system, named listing points and YOU SEE SOMETHING YOU SAY SOMETHING approach
            tailored to gather information about teenage pregancies and suspicious behaviour that
            can lead to teenage pregnancy from a family to the community reach.
